\section{Expected results}

\emph{What is the birth date of the first president of the United States?} This is the typical question that we would like to
answer quickly and succinctly with an automatic question answering system. This requires three steps.

Firstly, understanding the natural language. The input string given in standard 
English has to be transformed into a normal form. To do so, we will use natural 
language processing (NLP) libraries. We will also implement a machine learning 
(ML) algorithm, in order to improve the answers of our software.

Then, the normal form is used to collect data, by querying some databases (e.g. 
Wikidata). Some operations may then be applied, like performing a sort.

Finally, the desired answer is displayed.

\section{Target public}

The first goal of the PPP project is to provide a free, modular and well documented search engine tool that will 
interest research communities for extensibility features. Our purpose is to allow people to design their own modules and
easily include them in the tool. For example, sports modules could be done to answer questions about contests results or 
upcoming meetings.  We intend also to make at least one important module, using Wikidata, in order to provide a demo
and attract the big Wikipedia community. 

On the other hand, we also target the end users of the query answering system in order to allow researchers to focus on
their expertise domains and, maybe, to be able to provide this tool in open source mobile platforms like Firefox OS. At a
time when intelligent search engine tools are increasingly used, we think it is now or never for the open source community
to propose its own product.

\section{Concurrent services}

Several private companies offer question answering frameworks. 

WolframAlpha\footnote{\url{https://www.wolframalpha.com/}}, a tool developed by 
Wolfram Research, provide a web based service to answer directly questions asked
in English. It is well known for its abilities to process mathematical statements.
It focuses on historical and scientific facts, such as \emph{When was the French 
revolution?} or \emph{What is the root of pi?}.

Google Knowledge Graph\footnote{\url{http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html}}, Siri\footnote{\url{https://www.apple.com/fr/ios/siri/}} and Cortana\footnote{\url{http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/cortana}},
three intelligent personal assistants
developed respectively by Google, Apple and Microsoft, provide a mobile based service to 
answer questions asked in natural language (generally, those of the owner of the
mobile device). They focus on practical facts, such as \emph{Where is the nearest
restaurant?} but with also a support of historical facts.

In a first time, the PPP project aims at providing a clever way to browse Wikidata, by giving the 
user the direct answer to his question, not the link of the related Wikipedia
web page. Thus, our software will not be suited to answer such practical questions,
although some new modules can be made if there exists a related database. Google Now, Siri
and Cortana are therefore not direct concurrent services.

The PPP project is closer to the WolframAlpha tool. However, it is a free project,
and will be modular and well documented. We hope that it will interest the 
Wikimedia community, in order to keep it updated in the future. Moreover,
we will not focus on mathematical questions, as WolframAlpha does.

\section{Software}

The goal is to develop a query answering framework able to answer to simple questions with different back-ends. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.39]{images/Structure-PPP-en.eps}
    \caption{Global structure}
\end{figure}

The software is divided in several components which interact via the HTTP protocol.

First, there are the front-ends which are the user interfaces. The most natural is
a web page, but we can also think about a Android application
or a Firefox OS web app. Via this interface, we can submit a query.

The query is transformed into a standard form. This form has to be understandable 
for a computer and describe the question. This work is done in two ways. There is 
a classical natural language processing module and a machine learning-based module. 
This kind of transformation is very difficult. To avoid having to go through this 
step, we can develop another front-end for developers which allow to input a question
 directly in normal form.

The standard form is send into the core. The core's job is routing. It has to send 
the request in each module to obtain the answers. Sometime, a module can request 
an answer of another module, for example in the question "what is two times the 
population of the United States?" which needs a geographic data and a mathematical
 operation. Such a question needs the successive work of two modules.

To overcome the constraints of language, the core makes some request to the Wikidata
 module to translate each word of the standard form into the associated Wikidata 
 code.

Once a response is generated, it is sent to the interface to be displayed.

A specific module is needed for each database or kind of computation (mathematical, 
predictive machine learning\ldots).

\section{Technological innovations}

We would like to build one of the first open source question answering system. 
Our goal is to discover the theory of natural language processing, and apply our 
knowledge to design our tool. We intend to put together some existing libraries 
(e.g. natural language parsers) and our own implementations of algorithms. In 
particular, we hope we will be able to implement a neuronal network in order to 
perform machine learning. For example, we are going to explore deep learning
technologies for the natural language processing problem.

One of our most important goal is to provide the first full-modular question 
answering system. We do not pretend to build in 3 months a better tool than 
WolframAlpha for example, but we hope to make available an efficient and 
attractive system that will motivate people to integrate their own module in the 
tool. Thus, we think that using the HTTP protocol for the communication between 
modules is an important part of our project, because it will allow a wide variety 
of programming languages to design modules.

Finally, our technical approach consists in quickly obtaining first results and 
a first working tool. Thus, we could use existing libraries in a first time. Then, 
we will improve it depending on our remaining time.

\section{Schedule}

We have planned a simple schedule in two periods.

For the mid-term, we plan to have a functional developer front-end, core, 
Wikidata module (with the transformation in standard form with Wikidata codes), 
a first approach of the NLP parser and a base for machine learning. With this 
base, the software should be able to answer simple questions using the developer 
interface.

For the final term, we plan to have an enhanced NLP parser (especially for the 
machine learning-based one), a simple web front-end and a fully operational 
Wikidata module.

Depending on the remaining time, we can develop other modules, e.g. modules for 
OEIS, mathematics\ldots Our objective is not to provide a lot of modules, but a 
modular tool with at least one ``demo-module'' using Wikidata.

\section{Task partition}

We decide to form three working teams with mid-term and final evaluations goals. Some of them
may be split after the mid-term evaluation.

A first team, composed of Thomas and Valentin, has to develop the core and the front-ends.
This work should not take too long time, especially for the front-ends part. For the mid-term
we plan to have a working core, a basic HTML frontend and a developer frontend that would
allow input directly questions in the standard form. For the final evaluation, if there is time,
we will improve the HTML frontend and maybe build an Android application.

The second team will be charged with designing the first module, based on Wikidata. It is
composed of Thomas, Valentin and Tom. Thomas's knowledge on Wikidata will be essential
to make the work easier. The main goal is to have a module able to answer to simple questions
like \textit{When George Washington is born?} for the mid-term. This team could eventually be
split after in a team for enhanced Wikidata module and another for making new modules.

The NLP parsers (using eventually machine learning and neuronal networks) will be done by the
last team composed of Yassine, Quentin, Raphaël and Marc. Since we can not predict the difficulty
of this task, we do not know actually if some members of this team will design modules after.
The goal for the mid-term is to have a first NLP parser using intensively existing libaries and a
bibliographical study in order to understand how natural language parsers are designed, and then
choose our own approach. We hope to be able to have an implemented machine learning algorithm
based on neuronal networks for the final evaluation.

\section{Organization}

Beyond the work packages organization, three project members have also a specific role:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[Marc] is the project lead, whose task is also to make sure that the project is on the good way
    \item[Valentin] will do system administration (git repo    sitory infrastructure, continuous integration
    services, management of the demo server, \dots).
    \item[Thomas] is the software architect, whose task is to design the modular conception and to
    ensure that components fit well together.
\end{itemize}

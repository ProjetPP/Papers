6.  Add-ons                     (Marc)


## Communication

Quickly provide a website to present our project. No diffusion for the moment (wait to have something more serious). Use the GitHub webpage. Written with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)?

## Router

Router written in Python (NLP libraries written in Python or Java).

## Web interface

Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## NLP

Would be nice to test different existing libraries before any choice. **Must work with Linux.**

Remarks (Yassine & Marc): machine learning useless for NLP?

Improvements: when some user use the service, store the question, the provided answer, and the user's feelings (is the answer satisfying?), in order to improve the tool (not necessary ML). Could allow us to "hardcode" some questions.

Papers on the pad.

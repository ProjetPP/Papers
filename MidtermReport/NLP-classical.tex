\chapter{Classical Natural Language Processing}

The main goal of this module is to transform a question into a triple which can
be handled by backend modules. We have to process this sentence to obtain a simplified
and well structured triple, without losing relevant informations.

\section{Stanford CoreNLP}

Our work relies on the \emph{Stanford CoreNLP} library
\footnote{\url{http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml}}, developped by
the Stanford Natural Language Processing group, which include members with 
linguistics or computer science backgrounds. 

Since this library is written in Java, we use a wrapper, written in Python
\footnote{\url{https://bitbucket.org/ProgVal/corenlp-python/overview}}.

These tools provide a server running in background, which takes a character string,
and returns a dependency tree, with some additional informations on certain words.
See figure \ref{tree_before} to have an overview of such a tree, for the sentence
\emph{What is the birth date of the first president of the United States of America?}.

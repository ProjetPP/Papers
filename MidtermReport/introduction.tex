\section{Introduction}

The {\em Projet Pens√©es Profondes} (Deep Thoughts Project) aims at
providing a powerful software for answering questions written in a
natural language.
To accomplish this, we developped an eponymous set of tools that
accomplish different tasks and fit together thanks to a protocol
we developped.

These various tasks include data querying (using the young and open
knownledge base Wikidata), naturage language processing (using the
CoreNLP softward written by Stanford University and machine learning),
requests routing, web user interface, and feedback reporting.

Given the young age of this projet, these pieces are only starting
to emerge with their first features and mutual communications,
so we will describe them separately in this document without
much of a general overview of the project.

\lettrine{E}{ven though} the Projet Pens√©es Profondes has not yet started to actually
answer questions, we already made a huge progress in this direction
by having the structure of the project already up and running.

Few pieces remain to implement before we get something working as we
expect it and this means we do not see any incoming structural problem.
Thus we are confident in the future of the project and that it will
continue improving over time.

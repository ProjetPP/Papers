Even though the Projet Pens√©es Profondes has not yet started to 
answer questions, we already made a huge progress in this direction
by having the structure of the project already up and running.

Few pieces remain to be implemented before we get something working as we
expect, but we are confident in the future of the project and in its improvement
over time.

We keep the same organisation with few modifications, as presented in figure
\ref{conclusion:gantt}.

The new work package "Computer Algebra System" has to implement such a system in the PPP.

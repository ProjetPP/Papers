\section{Logging}

We decided to log all requests made to the PPP to improve our algorithms,
and particularily to feed the results to Natural Language Processing
modules that use Machine Learning.

The main idea is to log user feedback in addition to the requests
themselves: after showing the user the way we interpreted their
question alongside the answer to their request, we provide them a
way to give us feedback.
What we call feedback is actually a thumb up / thumb down pair of
buttons, and, if the latter is pressed, a way to correct the requests
parsing result so it can be fed to the Machine Learning algorithms.

Since Machine Learning algorithms are not ready yet, we did not focus
on this feature of the user interface and thus it is not implemented;
so far we only started implemented a backend that stores data
(gathered via the user interface) to a SQLite database.

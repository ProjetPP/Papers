Arriving to the midterm, we can see that only two work packages are supposed to be finished. Indeed, the software architecture is well defined. On the other hand, the web user interface needs to have more features than we thought at the beginning.

A major reorganization is about machine learning. We split it into two different work packages which implement two different machine learning algorithms.

In the other work package, the progression matches with what we expected.

Most of them produced, at least, a partially working code, allowing us to deploy the current state of the PPP on line:

There is also a website, for communication purpose:

In the proposal we produced this diagram.

Arriving to the midterm, we can see that only two work package which are supposed to be finished. Indeed, the software architecture is well defined. But, the Web user interface needs to have more features than we think at the beginning and it is not finished.

A major reorganization is about machine learning. We split it into two different work package which implements two different machine learning algorithm.

In the other work package, the progression match with what we expected.

More of them produced, at least, a partially working code so that we have already deploy the current state of the PPP on line (\url{ppp.pony.ovh}).

## TODO


### WP0
Found an expert, who read the webpage. Found the proposal interesting, but 
not clear on some points.


### WP1
Created an account. About the webpage proposed by Quentin to collect the dataset:
will include it in the PPP user interface (e.g. `Are you happy of the answer?`).


### WP2
Found an agreement for modules communications.
Several scripts to create modules automatically (PHP and Python).


### WP3
Updated proposal, taking into account what we said.


### WP4
Created a questions dataset (6000 questions). Algorithm: will use Stanford libraries, 
and then test some heuristics. Other proposition: do not make triple structures, 
but rather use typical questions (e.g. `How to ... ?` or `When was ... ?`).


### WP5
Functional router. Only one request for the moment (do not ask all modules).
Todo: add some log to register the asked questions.


### WP6
Not any work for the moment. Will begin this week.


### WP7
Downloaded a dictionnary. Write some code (C++) to use it. Will test his idea.
Expect to have first results (simple queries, learn some functions) in two weeks 
(with one week of computation for learning). Need functional Wikidata and core 
modules.

### WP8
Found a lookup table (260k words). Words encoded by vectors of float. Two
words with low distance are synonyms.

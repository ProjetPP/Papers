## TODO


### WP0
Found an expert, who read the webpage. Found the proposal interesting, but 
not clear on some points.


### WP1
Created an account. About the webpage proposed by Quentin to collect the dataset:
will include it in the PPP user interface (e.g. `Are you happy of the answer?`).


### WP2
Found an agreement for modules communications.
Several scripts to create modules automatically (PHP and Python).


### WP3
Updated proposal, taking into account what we said.


### WP4
Created a questions dataset. Algorithm: will use Stanford libraries, and then
test some heuristics.

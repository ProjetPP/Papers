The purpose of the three following modules is to transform questions into trees of triples, as described in section \ref{rdf}, which can be handled by backend modules.

The difficulty of this task can be illustrated on the following example: 
\begin{center}
 \textit{Where was the president of the United States born?}
\end{center}

A first possible tree is: (president of the United States, birth place, ?). However, the entity ``president of the United States'' is probably too complex to occur in a database. 

On the other hand, the following tree is much more easy to process: ((United States, president, ?), birth place, ?). In this case, the president of United States is identified (Barack Obama), the triple becomes (Barack Obama, birth place, ?), and finally the answer can be found easily in ``Barack Obama'' occurrence.

Our goal is to product simplified and well structured trees, without losing relevant information of the original question. We are developing three different approaches to tackle this problem. The first tries to analyse the grammatical structure of questions, the two other ones implement automatic learning techniques.

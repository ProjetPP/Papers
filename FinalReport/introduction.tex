The {\em Projet Pens√©es Profondes} (Deep Thought Project) aims at
providing a powerful software for answering questions written in
natural language.
To accomplish this, we developed an eponymous set of tools that
accomplish different tasks and fit together thanks to a protocol
we developed.

These various tasks include data querying (using the young and open
knowledge base \Wikidata), question parsing (using machine learning and the
\CoreNLP software written by Stanford University),
requests routing, web user interface, and feedback reporting.

Given the young age of this project, these pieces are only starting
to emerge with their first features and mutual communications,
so we will describe them separately in this document without
much of a general overview of the project.

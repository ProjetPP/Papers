The \emph{Projet Pens√©es Profondes} (Deep Thought Project) provides a powerfull,
modular and open-source application to answer questions written in natural languages.
We developed an eponymous set of tools that accomplish different tasks and fit
together thanks to a well defined protocol.

These various tasks include data querying (using the young and open
knowledge base Wikidata), question parsing (using machine learning and the
\CoreNLP software written by Stanford University),
requests routing, web user interface, feedback reporting, computer algebra, etc.

A deployment of these tools, \emph{Platypus}, is available online:

\section{Spell Checker}

The spell checker is a Python module\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ProjetPP/PPP-Spell-Checker}}
which aims at correcting spelling mistakes in the sentence.
Indeed, errors are often made by the user, and we want to avoid her/his query to fail.

This module uses the \emph{GNU Aspell} library\footnote{\url{http://aspell.net/}},
with a Python wrapper\footnote{\url{https://github.com/WojciechMula/aspell-python}}.
Aspell is an open source software, and is the standard spell checker on GNU/Linux.

Here are the steps of the algorithm.

Input sentence:
\begin{center}
Who is the auhtor of "Le Petit Prince"?
\end{center}

Get all the words of the sentence:
\begin{center}
[Who, is, the, auhtor, of, Le, Petit, Prince]
\end{center}

Apply the Aspell corrector on each individual word which is not contained on a
quotation in the original sentence:
\begin{center}
[Who, is, the, author, of, Le, Petit, Prince]
\end{center}

Replace the words in the sentence, taking care of keeping the punctuation as is:
\begin{center}
Who is the author of "Le Petit Prince"?
\end{center}

Remark that it is necessary to keep the words of a quotation unchanged, otherwise
we would have modified "Le Petit Prince" since it is not correct English, although
it is the correct title of the book.

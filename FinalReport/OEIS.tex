\section{OEIS module}

The OEIS, Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences\footnote{\url{https://oeis.org/}}, is a database of integer
sequences; it contains their first numbers, name, description, etc.

This module\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ProjetPP/PPP-OEIS}} allows the
PPP to query this database in order to answer simple questions, like
“What follows 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32?”, or “What is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32?”,
by using a small OEIS library\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ProgVal/Supybot-plugins/blob/master/OEIS/oeis.py}}
